    <h1>Selecting with ::nth-last-pseudo</h1>
    <p>
         The <code>::nth-last-pseudo</code> selector matches from the end of the matched pseudo-elements list. It can match pseudo-elements by a specific index (not ordinal), <code>odd</code>, <code>even</code> or an+b formula (e.g.: 2n+1).
    </p>
    <p>
        The demo works correctly if both the 'control' and 'pseudo-elements' sections look exactly the same. Take a look at the source code.
