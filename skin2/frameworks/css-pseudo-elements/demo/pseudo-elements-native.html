    <h1>CSS pseudo-elements and native ::before/::after</h1>
    <p>
        The native <code>::before</code> and <code>::before(1)</code> identify the same pseudo-element; likewise for <code>::after</code> and <code>::after(1)</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The demo works correctly if both the 'control' and 'pseudo-elements' sections look exactly the same. Take a look at the source code.
    </p>

        <h2>Control</h2>
        <div id="control">
            123 - ABC
        </div>   
    </section>

        <h2>Pseudo-elements</h2>
